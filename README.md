Answer for Highest Palindrome

1.  Time Complexity

    a. Recursive Calls

    Recursion Depth:
    In the worst case, the recursion depth can be up to `n/2`, where `n` is the length of the string.
    Each recursive call processes two characters (one from the left and one from the right).
    Number of Recursive Calls:
    At each level of recursion, there are two possible modifications (modifying either `i` or `j`), leading to 2 recursive calls per character mismatch.
    This results in `O(2^(n/2))` possible recursive paths in the worst case when no characters match and k is large enough to allow all changes.

    b. String Slicing

    Cost per Recursive Call:
    Each recursive call involves slicing the string, which is an `O(n)` operation.
    This adds an additional `O(n)` cost per recursive call.

Conclusion: The time complexity is `O(n * 2^(n/2))` in the worst case due to the exponential number of recursive paths and the cost of string slicing.

2. Space Complexity

   a. Recursion Stack

   Maximum Depth:
   The maximum recursion depth is `O(n)`, corresponding to the depth of the recursion tree.

   b. String Storage

   String Slices:
   Each recursive call creates new string slices.
   JS has efficiently manages string immutability, but the new strings contribute to space usage proportional to the recursion depth.

Conclusion: The space complexity is `O(n)` due to the recursion stack depth and temporary string slices.
